# MDETECT: Malware Detection from Network Captures using Machine
Learning

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Getting Started

From the home directory of the project the python package can be
installed using the following command:

``` {bash}
pip install -e .
```

The python package included in this repo `mdetect` also defines three
command line scripts which can be used to run the project from the
command line. These scripts are defined in the `01_cli.ipynb` notebook
and are as follows:

- `malware-train`: Train a model on a set of PCAP files, this will run
  the training loop given paths to directories containing the PCAP files
  for malware and benign samples. The model is saved to a pickle file
  and can be used for prediction (malware-predict).
- `malware-transform`: Transform a set of PCAP files into a set of
  features which can be used for classification. This just performs the
  feature engineering step and saves the features CSV files for the
  flows provided alongside labels for the flows.
- `malware-predict`: Predict the labels for a set of flows using a
  trained model. This will load a model from a pickle file and then use
  the model to predict the labels for the flows provided. Currently this
  script prints the number of malware flows identified in the file and
  the total number of flows in the file.

Each of these scripts can be run with the `--help` flag to get more
information on the arguments required. This report is a high level
overview of the project and the notebooks contain more detailed
information on the implementation of the project.
